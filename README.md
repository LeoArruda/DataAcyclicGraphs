# Apache Airflow: Complete Hands-On 


## Install Apache Airflow

As explained in the course before making use of this code base you need to install Apache Airflow locally on your machine.

```Bash
pip install apache-airflow[gcp,statsd,sentry]
```

Install these extra packages as well.

```Bash
pip install cryptography
pip install pyspark
```

To validate your Airflow installation check your Airflow version. This should print >= 1.10.10.

```Bash
airflow version
```

If you have installed Airflow earlier you might get a DeprecationWarning about having multiple airflow.cfg files but thatâ€™s okay as long as you set the correct AIRFLOW_HOME environment variable in your Terminal.

# Initialize an Airflow environment

As a next step you need to initialize an Airflow environment locally to run DAGs.

Set the AIRFLOW_HOME variable.

```Bash
export AIRFLOW_HOME=path/to/this/directory
```

Initialize Airflow and the metadata database.

```Bash
airflow initdb
```

Now, you can run both the web server and the scheduler.

Run the web server.

```Bash
airflow webserver
```

In a different terminal window/session where you set the AIRFLOW_HOME variable again run the scheduler.

```Bash
airflow scheduler
```

Great!ðŸŽ‰ Now you can access the Airflow web UI on http://localhost:8080.
